    <h1>Hello there, I’m Aalia.</h1>
    <p>A curious wanderer, an avid reader, and a dreamer of worlds both real and fantastical. I’m a high school student with a passion for self-improvement and a love for travel, which allows me to discover and immerse myself in various cultures and cuisines.</p>

    <p>When I'm not out exploring the world, you can find me engrossed in the pages of a fantasy novel, studying for school, or cultivating my curiosity, intellect, and sense of self. Born to Muslim Indian parents and raised alongside a younger sister, I have an introverted yet nurturing personality. I treasure the time spent alone, devoted to books, learning new skills, or simply daydreaming.</p>

    <p>My aspirations are to be the best cat mom ever, find a fulfilling career that I’m passionate about, spend quality time with my family and the family I’ll have in the future, and leave a positive impact on the world for generations to come.</p>
